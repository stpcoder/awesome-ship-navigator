# 🚢 Awesome Ship Navigator

Advanced Ship Navigation System with Collision Avoidance

## Overview

A comprehensive ship navigation system that combines A* pathfinding with intelligent collision avoidance. The system optimizes both departure times and routes to prevent collisions while minimizing total travel time.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Navigation
- **A* Grid-based Pathfinding**: Reliable obstacle avoidance with safety buffers
- **Multi-Ship Support**: Simultaneous path planning for multiple vessels
- **Path Smoothing**: Optimized waypoints for cleaner routes

### Advanced Collision Avoidance (v4) ⭐
- **Smart Optimization**: Compares departure delay vs route detour costs
- **Unified Cost Function**: All costs measured in time (minutes)
- **Real-world Units**: Speed in knots, distance in nautical miles
- **Multi-solution Analysis**: Tests 30+ solutions to find optimal strategy

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```

#### Collision Avoidance System (Recommended) ⭐
```bash
python collision_avoidance_v4.py
```

## 📊 Collision Avoidance Algorithm

### How It Works

1. **Collision Detection**
   - Safety distance: 0.5 nautical miles
   - Time-based position tracking
   - Interval-based collision prediction

2. **Cost Optimization**
   ```
   Total Cost (minutes) = Departure Delay + Detour Time
   Detour Time = Additional Distance (nm) / Speed (knots) × 60
   ```

3. **Solution Strategy**
   - Tests departure times from -30 to +120 minutes
   - Generates alternative paths with varying avoidance radii
   - Selects solution with minimum total time cost

### Real-world Scale
- 1 pixel = 10 meters = 0.0054 nautical miles
- Safety distance = 0.5 nautical miles (≈93 pixels)

## 📈 Example Scenario

### Ship Configuration
- **Ship A**: 15 knots, departs at t=0
- **Ship B**: 10 knots, departs at t=50
- **Ship C**: 12 knots, requests t=0 → auto-adjusted to avoid collision

### Results
- Initial collision detected: t=[14.5, 17.0] minutes
- Optimal solution: Delay Ship C by 20 minutes
- Total cost: 20 minutes (no route change needed)
- All collisions successfully avoided! 🎉

## 📸 Results & Analysis

### Main Results Dashboard

The system successfully coordinates 3 ships with different speeds:
- **Left panel**: Ship paths with departure times
- **Right panels**: Time-space diagram, speed comparison, and summary

### Path Comparison Over Time
![Path Comparison](path_comparison_v4.png)

Shows Ship C's position at different time points (t=0, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40):
- Blue/Green circles: Safety zones around Ships A & B
- Red paths: Ship C's original vs optimized route
- Result: No route change needed, only time adjustment

### Collision Detail Analysis
![Collision Detail](collision_detail_v4.png)

Detailed view of the avoided collision:
- Red X: Where collision would have occurred at t=15.75
- Distance: Ships would have been only ~40 pixels apart (under 0.5nm safety limit)
- Solution: 20-minute delay moves Ship C out of collision timeframe

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```python
# Unified cost function
def calculate_unified_cost(ship, new_departure, new_path):
    departure_delay = abs(new_departure - original_departure)
    detour_time = additional_distance / ship.speed_pixels_per_minute
    return departure_delay + detour_time
```

### Output Visualizations

When running `collision_avoidance_v4.py`, three visualizations are generated:

1. **collision_avoidance_v4.png**: Main results with paths and metrics
2. **path_comparison_v4.png**: Time-series comparison of paths
3. **collision_detail_v4.png**: Detailed collision scenario analysis

## 📝 Key Insights

### Why Time Delay Over Route Change?

The optimizer tested **34 different solutions** and found:
1. **20-min delay only**: Total cost = 20.0 minutes ✅ (Selected)
2. **22-min delay + 0.18nm detour**: Total cost = 22.9 minutes
3. **Other combinations**: All cost more than 20 minutes

**Conclusion**: For short collision windows (2.5 minutes), waiting is more efficient than detouring.

The system intelligently chooses between:
- **Time delay**: Wait before departure
- **Route change**: Take a longer path
- **Combined approach**: Both delay and detour

This demonstrates the power of unified cost function - converting all factors to time enables fair comparison.
